# Element X Android

Element X Android is a [Matrix](https://matrix.org/) Android Client provided by [element.io](https://element.io/). This app is currently in a pre-alpha release stage with only basic functionalities.

The application is a total rewrite of [Element-Android](https://github.com/element-hq/element-android) using the [Matrix Rust SDK](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk) underneath and targeting devices running Android 7+. The UI layer is written using [Jetpack Compose](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/compose), and the navigation is managed using [Appyx](https://github.com/bumble-tech/appyx).

Learn more about why we are building Element X in our blog post: [https://element.io/blog/element-x-experience-the-future-of-element/](https://element.io/blog/element-x-experience-the-future-of-element/).

## Translations

Element X Android supports many languages. You can help us to translate the app in your language by joining our [Localazy project](https://localazy.com/p/element). You can also help us to improve the existing translations.

Note that for now, we keep control on the French and German translations.

Translations can be checked screen per screen using our tool Element X Android Gallery, available at https://element-hq.github.io/element-x-android/. Note that this page is updated every Tuesday. 

More instructions about translating the application can be found at [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md#strings).

## Rust SDK

Element X leverages the [Matrix Rust SDK](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-rust-sdk) through an FFI layer that the final client can directly import and use.

We're doing this as a way to share code between platforms and while we've seen promising results it's still in the experimental stage and bound to change.

## Status

This project is in work in progress. The app does not cover yet all functionalities we expect. The list of supported features can be found in [this issue](https://github.com/element-hq/element-x-android/issues/911).

## Contributing
