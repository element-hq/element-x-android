     *
     * - The SDK takes a while to report this value, resulting in a delay of 1-2s in displaying the UI.
     * - We need to add a 'Skip' option for testing purposes, which would not be possible if we relied only on the SDK.
     * - The SDK sometimes doesn't report the verification state if there is no network connection when the app boots.
