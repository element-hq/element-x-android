/**
 * Can represent the current global app navigation state.
 * @param owner mostly a Node identifier associated with the state.
 * We are using the owner parameter to check when calling onLeaving methods is still using the same owner than his companion onNavigate.
 * Why this is needed : for now we rely on lifecycle methods of the node, which are async.
 * If you navigate quickly between nodes, onCreate of the new node is called before onDestroy of the previous node.
 * So we assume if we don't get the same owner, we can skip the onLeaving action as we already replaced it.
