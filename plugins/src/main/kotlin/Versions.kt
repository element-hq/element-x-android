/**
 * Version codes are quite sensitive, because there is a mix between bundle and APKs.
 * Max versionCode allowed by the PlayStore (for information):
 * 2_100_000_000
 *
 * Also note that the versionCode is multiplied by 10 in app/build.gradle.kts:
 * ```
 * output.versionCode.set((output.versionCode.orNull ?: 0) * 10 + abiCode)
 * ```
 * We are using a CalVer-like approach to version the application. The version code is calculated as follows:
 * - 2 digits for the year
 * - 2 digits for the month
 * - 1 (or 2) digits for the release number
 * Note that the version codes need to be greater than the ones calculated for the previous releases, so we use
 * year on 4 digits for this internal value.
 * So for instance, the first release of Jan 2025 will have:
 * - the version name: 25.01.0
 * - the version code: 20250100a (202_501_00a) where `a` stands for the architecture code
