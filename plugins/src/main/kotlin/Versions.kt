/**
 * Version codes are quite sensitive, because there is a mix between bundle and APKs, and we have to take into
 * account the future upgrade of Element Android.
 * Max versionCode allowed by the PlayStore (for information):
 * 2_100_000_000
 * Current version code of EAx on the PlayStore, for the first uploaded beta (we cannot go below):
 * ----1_001_000
 * Current version code of EAx on the nightly:
 * ----1_001_000
 * Current version of Element Android (at some point EAx will replace this app) (v1.6.3)
 * ----40_106_03a where a stands for the architecture: 1, 2, 3, 4 and 0 for the universal APK
 * Current version of EAx distributed with Firebase app distribution:
 * ----1_002_000
 * Latest version of EAx distributed with Firebase app distribution (downgrading, so that's a problem)
 * -------10_200
 * Version when running the current debug build
 * -------10_200
 *
 * So adding 4_000_000 to the current version Code computed here should be fine, and since the versionCode
 * is multiplied by 10 in app/build.gradle.kts#L168:
 * ```
 * output.versionCode.set((output.versionCode.get() ?: 0) * 10 + abiCode))
 * ```
 * we will have:
 * Release version:
 * ---40_001_020
 * Nightly version:
 * ---40_001_020
 * Debug version:
 * ---40_010_200
