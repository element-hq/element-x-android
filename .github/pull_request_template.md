## Content

<!-- Describe shortly what has been changed -->

## Motivation and context

<!-- Provide link to the corresponding issue if applicable or explain the context -->

## Screenshots / GIFs

<!--
We have screenshot tests in the project, so attaching screenshots to a PR is not mandatory, as far as there
is a Composable Preview covering the changes. In this case, the change will appear in the file diff.
Note that all the UI composables should be covered by a Composable Preview.

Providing a video of the change is still very useful for the reviewer and for the history of the project.

You can use a table like this to show screenshots comparison.
Uncomment this markdown table below and edit the last line `|||`:
|copy screenshot of before here|copy screenshot of after here|

|Before|After|
