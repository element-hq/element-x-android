# kotlinx.serialization

# Kotlin serialization looks up the generated serializer classes through a function on companion
# objects. The companions are looked up reflectively so we need to explicitly keep these functions.
-keepclasseswithmembers class **.*$Companion {
    kotlinx.serialization.KSerializer serializer(...);
}
# If a companion has the serializer function, keep the companion field on the original type so that
# the reflective lookup succeeds.
-if class **.*$Companion {
  kotlinx.serialization.KSerializer serializer(...);
}
-keepclassmembers class <1>.<2> {
  <1>.<2>$Companion Companion;
}
