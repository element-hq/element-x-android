Main changes in this version:
- Element Call is now enabled by default.
- There is an 'ongoing call' indicator in the room list.
- Adding mentions to a message is now possible, but it's disabled by default as it's a work in progress. They can be enabled in the developer options.
- Voice messages behavior changed: there is no need to keep pressing to record, to start recording a message just tap on the mic button, then tap again to stop recording.
- Added a marker in the timeline to indicate the starting point of the room messages.
