Element X brings you both sovereign & seamless collaboration built on Matrix.

The collaboration capabilities include chat & video calls with the modern set of features such as:
 • public & private channels
 • room moderation & access control
 • replies, reactions, polls, read receipts, pinned messages, etc.
 • simultaneous chat & calls (picture in picture)
 • decentralized & federated communication across organizations

All this comes in a secure & sovereign fashion without compromising responsiveness or overall usability of the app:
 • enterprise-grade single sign-on
 • easy & secure login & device verification via QR-code
 • end to end encryption & zero trust
 • protection against MITM & other cyber attacks

If you’re a new user, use the new Element X app from the start. Compared to the current Element app you will get:
 • greatly enhanced performance, sleek user interface and overall better user experience
 • enterprise-grade support for single sign-on (OIDC)
 • QR-code based login & device verification
 • natively integrated Element Call for video calls
 • continuous improvements, bug fixes and new features

If you’re an existing user, using the current Element app - check out the new Element X and start planning your transition. The current Element app will be phased out and will only get critical security updates.

<b>Own your data</b>
Matrix-based, Element X lets you self-host your data or choose from any free public server (the default is matrix.org, but there are plenty of others to choose from). However you host, you have ownership; it’s your data. You’re not the product. You’re in control.

<b>Interoperate natively</b>
Enjoy the freedom of the Matrix open standard! You have native interoperability with any other Matrix-based app. So just like email, it doesn't matter if your friends, partners or customers are on a different Matrix-based app - you can still connect.

<b>Encrypt your data</b>
Enjoy your right to private conversations - free from data mining, ads and all the rest of it - and stay secure. Only the people in your conversation can read your messages.

<b>Chat across multiple devices</b>
Stay in touch wherever you are with fully synchronized message history across all your devices, even those running Element legacy app, and on the web at https://app.element.io
